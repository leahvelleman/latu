# Phonology
## Vowels 

There are six basic vowels: the five cardinal vowels, spelled **a e i o u,**
and /1/, spelled **y.** All six occur both short and long, and written with
a macron when they are long.

|                  |                  |
|------------------|------------------|
| {{ prize | f }}  | {{ poison | f }} |
| {{ boot | f }}   | {{ music | f }}  |
| {{ little | f }} | {{ broken | f }} |
| {{ lake | f }}   |  {{ soap | f }}  |
| {{ problem | f }}|  {{ knife | f }} |
| {{ bite | f }}   | {{ island | f }} |

There are three diphthongs, **ia io iu**, pronounced /ja jo ju/. Other than in
these diphthongs, the [j]-sound does not occur.

- {{ see | f }}
- {{ _open | f }}
- {{ point_out | f }}

The diphthongs also occur with the second element long.

- {{ hat | f }}
- {{ night | f }}
- {{ village | f }}

Roots often have two identical vowels, like the examples in this section.
Another common pattern is an **i** in the first syllable and a diphthong
in the second.

## Consonants

There are fourteen consonant phonemes. 

|                | Bilabial | Alveolar | Velar | Glottal |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Voiceless stop | **p** /p/ | **t** /t/ | **k** /k/ | **’** /ʔ/ |
| Voiced stop    | **b** /b/ | **d** /d/ | **g** /g/ |  |
| Fricative | | **s** /s/ | **wh** /ʍ/ | **h** /h/ | 
| Nasal | **m** /m/ | **n** /n/ | | | 
| Liquid | | **l** /l/ | **w** /w/ | |

Before **i**, the consonants **t d s** palatalize to [tʃ dʒ ʃ]. Before a
diphthong, these consonants palatalize and the first element of the diphthong
becomes silent. These changes are reflected in writing: the palatalized
consonants are written **ch j sh**.
